**Server Side:** Use code like...

```cs
Request.Browser["IsMobile"]
```

or 

```cs
Request.Browser["IsTablet"]
```

... from within a web application server side to determine the requesting device type.

**Client Side:** Include...

```
https://[YOUR DOMAIN]/51Degrees.features.js?DeviceType&ScreenInchesDiagonal
```

... from Javascript to retrieve device type and physcial screen size information. Use Google Analytics custom dimensions to add this data for more granular analysis.

**Offline:** Use...

```cs
var detectionProvider = new Provider(StreamFactory.Create("[DATA FILE LOCATION]"));
var deviceType = detectionProvider.Match("[YOUR USERAGENT]")["DeviceType"];
```

... to perform offline analysis of web logs with User-Agent headers.

## What's needed?

The simplest method of deploying 51Degrees device detection to a .NET project is with NuGet. Just search for [51Degrees on NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=51degrees "51Degrees Packages on NuGet").

This GitHub repository and NuGet include 51Degrees free Lite device database. The Lite data is updated monthly by our professional team of analysts. 

Data files which are updated weekly and daily, automatically, and with more properties and device combinationsare also available.

## Recent Changes

### Version 3.2 Highlights

This release focuses on reducing memory consumption and improving performance when the device data file is used directly from the disk.

**Important Change:** _The embedded device data has been removed from the assembly and by default placed in the App_Data folder for both web and non-web projects. The solution will not work without the associated data file being provided and the WebProvider.ActiveProvider property can now return null._

### Major Changes in Version 3.2

* Embedded data has been removed from the assembly and now must be provided from the App_Data folder.
* .NET 3.5 is not supported in this release in order to use memory mapped files and simplify overriding default browser capabilities.
* In stream mode entity data properties that can allocate large arrays only initialise these arrays when needed.
* Caches used with stream operation are now fixed memory size and serviced via the thread pool.
* Automatic update processes uses temporary files rather than main memory to verify integrity of updated files prior to using them.
* Temporary files are now created in the App_Data/51Degrees folder of the web application rather than a UNC path or the master data file folder.
* Values associated with Profiles are now retrieved using a more efficient algorithm.
* DataSet.Properties collection now has a string accesser to make retrieving properties by name simpler.
* Web sites using memory mode use a byte array to improve start up time.
* Version 3.2 data file formats are supported in parallel with version 3.1 data files.
* 51Degrees unit tests are now part of the open source distribution.

### Changes from 3.2.9

Summary of API changes:

* Added support for device data files which include JavaScript that can override property value results. Values returned as a result of JavaScript snippets are termed dynamic values as they are determined at runtime for the web browser rather than when the data file was generated. The screen width in pixels for a laptop or desktop computer calculated using JavaScript would be an example of a dynamic value. This feature requires a data file which includes JavaScript properties that provide dynamic property values. ScreenPixelsWidth and ScreenPixelsHeight are examples of properties that now support dynamic values.
* The Auto Update process has been altered to correctly set the If-Modified-Since header rather than the work around header used to overcome a limitation in the WebClient implementation.
* Generic data structure classes including the cache and lists have been altered to support any data set class type not just those used for device detection.
